[ ] - Fix multitude of bugs

## Known bugs

* When a player leaves a game, it causes the game to crash, players who leave need to be replaced by bots
* When a game ends, bugs may happen when trying to leave
* If a game ends from one of the above bugs, it can lead to no one being able to join a game, only create them.
